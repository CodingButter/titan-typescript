JS Fuels My Engine

#### \<What {...is} my="Focus"/>:

My goal was to create a game engine that is
just as much about having complete control over
the application and making it "YOUR OWN" experience
as it is about being able to make games.

Not sure about anyone else but I enjoy diving into customizing
the tools I use as I do using the tools themselves. Thats what I'm
focusing on with this project.

#### \<Where am="I">

So far I have created a bunch of hook based interactions. and implemented.
