JS Fuels My Engine

## \<What {...is} my="Focus" />

The vision behind this project is to create a game engine that puts unparalleled control into the hands of developers, enabling them to shape their applications into something uniquely their own. It’s not just about building games—it’s about crafting an ecosystem that adapts to your specific needs, preferences, and creative vision.

This engine is designed to be a playground for innovation, where developers have the flexibility to modify, expand, and fully customize the tools they rely on. For me, the process of personalizing my tools is just as exciting and rewarding as using them. Whether it's tailoring the UI, adjusting workflows, or adding entirely new capabilities, I want TITAN to be as much about the journey of creation as the end result itself.
